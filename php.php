Why PHP?
PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.
PHP is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.
PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
PHP is a widely-used, open source scripting language.
PHP scripts are executed on the server.
PHP is free to download and use.
The main way to store information in the middle of a PHP program is by using a variable.
Here are the most important things to know about variables in PHP.
All variables in PHP are denoted with a leading dollar sign ($).
The value of a variable is the value of its most recent assignment.
Variables are assigned with the = operator, with the variable on the left-hand side and the expression to be evaluated on the right.
Variables can, but do not need, to be declared before assignment.
Variables in PHP do not have intrinsic types - a variable does not know in advance whether it will be used to store a number or a string of characters.
Variables used before they are assigned have default values.
